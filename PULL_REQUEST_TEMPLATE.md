# Quality checklist

When you are assessing a document for quality, use the checklist at
https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-rackspace/blob/master/quality/qc-editorial-checklist.md to ensure
that the content meets minimal writing and style requirements.

Use this checklist on new and existing documents for which you have received a pull
request (PR) before submitting the PR to the technical editor for editing.
