Overview
-----------------------------------------

The Rackspace Cloud Backup service is a file-based backup application that enables you to choose which files and folders to back up from your cloud server. You can choose to restore your whole system with all of its folders and files, to restore individual files or folders from a given date, or to restore to an entirely different server.

Interactions with Rackspace Cloud Backup occur programmatically via the Rackspace Cloud Backup API as described in this internal *Rackspace Cloud Backup Administration Guide*
and in the following external guides that are available on :rax-devdocs:`Rackspace API Documentation<>`:

-  *Rackspace Cloud Backup Getting Started*

-  *Rackspace Cloud Backup API Reference*

-  *Rackspace Cloud Backup Release Notes*
