+===============+=================+===========================================================+
|204            | No Content      | The server successfully fulfilled the request. There is   |
|               |                 | no additional content to send in the response body.       |
+---------------+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|400            | Bad Request     | The server cannot or will not process the request         |
|               |                 | due to something that is perceived as a client error      |
|               |                 | (for example, malformed syntax, invalid request framing,  |
|               |                 | or deceptive request routing).                            |
+---------------+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|401            | Unauthorized    | The request has not been applied because it lacks         |
|               |                 | valid authentication credentials for the target           |
|               |                 | resource. The credentials are either expired or invalid.  |
+---------------+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|403            | Forbidden       | The server understood the request but refuses             |
|               |                 | to authorize it.                                          |
+---------------+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|404            | Not Found       | The server did not find a current representation          |
|               |                 | for the target resource or is not willing to              |
|               |                 | disclose that one exists.                                 |
+---------------+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|405            | Method Not      | The method received in the request line is                |
|               | Allowed         | known by the origin server but is not supported by        |
|               |                 | the target resource.                                      |
+---------------+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|409            | Conflict        | The request could not be completed due to a conflict with |
|               |                 | the current state of the resource.                        |
+---------------+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|500            | Internal Server | The server encountered an unexpected condition            |
|               | Error           | that prevented it from fulfilling the request.            |
+---------------+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|503            | Service         | The server is currently unable to handle the request      |
|               | Unavailable     | due to a temporary overload or scheduled maintenance,     |
|               |                 | which will likely be alleviated after some delay.         |
